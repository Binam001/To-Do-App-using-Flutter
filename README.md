This is my first simple flutter project.
It is developed on Project IDX => Firebase Studio
Now, I am again switching to react-native.
Because:
  -It shows so many syntax error, type error.
  -To style something, it is so difficult. Like: 
              title: Text('To Do', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
              Text(
                taskName,
                style: TextStyle(
                  decoration:
                      taskCompleted
                          ? TextDecoration.lineThrough
                          : TextDecoration.none,
                ),
              ),
